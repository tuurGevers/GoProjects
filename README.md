# Welcome to My Go Projects!

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a self-taught developer who's been on a coding adventure since I was about 12. It all started with Scratch, and boy, has it been a journey!

## Quick Coding Timeline:
- **Early Steps:** Kicked things off with Scratch.
- **Experimenting:** When I got into STEM in the first grade of middle school, I started messing around with some Python here and there.
- **Shift to Web Dev:** Started to take things seriously with web development using JavaScript, Python, and C# around 15-16.
- **Exploration:** Branched out to Kotlin and then got hooked on game development with Unreal Engine.
- **Now:** These days, Iâ€™m all about Go, diving into backend development and AI integrations.

## Why Go?
Goâ€™s efficiency and powerful control for backend and AI applications have really caught my eye. I appreciate its balance of high-level ease with low-level power, making it ideal for building sophisticated, performant software. Iâ€™m here to fine-tune my skills in Go and share my progress. This repo is a collection of my Go experiments and projects.

## What's Next?
Iâ€™m looking to get deeper into backend tech and AI, trying to figure out innovative ways to blend them into fun and useful projects. Want to chat about tech or possibly collaborate? Drop me a message!

Thanks for dropping by! Enjoy browsing through my work and do share your thoughts!
